# BlursEd
The Blessed Cursed text Editor

## Goals
* [ ] A fully functional modal text editor
* [ ] Configurable and automatable via a turing complete configuration language 
* [ ] Self learnable (Should be possible to learn how to use it without wiki pages)

## Build Steps
This project uses cmake as the build system. I've made a script [build.sh](build.sh) that will automatically generate a build directory in the project root. After running this script, the executible will be ./build/scr/blursed. To clean, run the [clean.sh](clean.sh) scrupt.
